# 🐉 Dragon News

Dragon News is a simple practice news website built with React. It uses dummy data from a custom JSON file and is meant to help me learn the basics of:

- React components & routing
- Firebase authentication
- Deployment
- General project structure and styling

This is not a production site — just a learning project.
